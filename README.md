MultiprocessorScheduler
=======================

Comparison of scheduling algorithms for multiprocessor systems. C

Heurisitic Scheduler:
Intuitive scheduling where the assumption that the optimal solution will be where each processor shares the average load of all tasks. 

Parametric Scheduler:
A binary search for the optimal solution.

Dynammic Programming:
Dynamic programming method, where the solution is split into sub-problems and bottom-up approach is used to reach final solution.
